# String to Template Literal Converter

This Visual Studio Code extension allows developers to quickly convert standard strings enclosed in single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes to template literals with backticks (\`\`). This conversion is triggered by a simple keyboard shortcut: ``Ctrl+Shift+` `` on Windows/Linux and ``Cmd+Shift+` `` on macOS, making it easier to insert variables or expressions into strings.

## Features

- **Quick Conversion**: Convert any string to a template literal with a simple keyboard shortcut.
- **Support for Single and Double Quotes**: Works with strings enclosed in both single and double quotes.
- **Streamlines Development**: Speeds up the process of working with dynamic strings in JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Usage

1. Place your cursor inside a string (or select the entire string) that you want to convert to a template literal.
2. Use the keyboard shortcut ``Ctrl+Shift+` `` (or ``Cmd+Shift+` ``on macOS).
3. The string will automatically be converted to a template literal, with the original quotes replaced by backticks.

Example: Converting `"Hello, ${name}!"` by triggering the command will change it to `` `Hello, ${name}!` ``.
